# LaTeX Beamer: Minima Slides

This projects wants to provide modern and simplistic LaTeX Beamer slides for professional and private use. The slides include

- two title templates
- simple content (text, enumeration)
- a template for mathematical content (definition, theorem, proof)
- a template for algorithmic content (algorithm in pseudo-code)
- highlighting options (block, stripe)
- a highlighting page

Altering the three colors `lightgray`, `darkgray` and `gray` in the file `beamercolorthememinima.sty` gives an opportunity to adapt the slides easily to other color schemes.

Three exemplary color schemes [gray](https://jzenn.github.io/projects/minima-slides-examples), [blue](https://jzenn.github.io/projects/minima-slides-examples) and [red](https://jzenn.github.io/projects/minima-slides-examples) are
provided for inspection.
